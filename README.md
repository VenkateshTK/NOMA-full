# NOMA
* Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access Power Optimisation Using Particle Swarm Optimisation(PSO) and Neural network.
* Given total power, channel characteristics, PSO is modified to find the power distribution such that it maximises the channel capacity with minimal requirement of service on each link.
* Achieve the same regression using neural network.

## Repo
* Matlab code for PSO is in PSO folder named data_generate
* dataset_with_single_variance consists of dataset generated using only one fixed variance of the channel co-efficients.
* dataset_with_different_variances consists of dataset generated using many different values of variances ranging from 1-20.
* data_refined folder contains files for NN with removing unnecessary data.
* plots folder contains some of the performance check of the NN.
