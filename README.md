# NOMA
* Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access Power Optimisation Using Particle Swarm Optimisation(PSO) and Neural network.
* Given total power, channel characteristics, PSO is modified to find the power distribution such that it maximises the channel capacity with minimal requirement of service on each link.
* Achieve the same regression using neural network.
